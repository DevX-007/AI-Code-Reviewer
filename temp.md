❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a+b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` attempts to add variables `a` and `b` without them being defined within the function's scope or
passed as arguments.
* ❌ The function lacks input parameters, making it inflexible and tightly coupled to variables in the global scope (if
they exist).

✅ Recommended Fix:
```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ The `sum` function now accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`, making it reusable and predictable.
* ✔ The function encapsulates its logic and depends only on its inputs, adhering to good programming practices.
* ✔ The function is now more testable, as the output can be easily verified for different inputs.
